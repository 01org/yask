Yet Another Stencil Kernel: A framework to facilitate exploration of the HPC stencil-performance design space, including
•Vector folding,
•Cache blocking,
•Memory layout,
•Loop construction,
•And many others.
YASK contains a specialized source-to-source translator to convert scalar C++ stencil code to SIMD-optimized code for Intel(R) Xeon Phi(TM) processors.
